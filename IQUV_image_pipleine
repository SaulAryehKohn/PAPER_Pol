"IQUV IMAGE PIPELINE"
=========================
batch_mk_df_images.sh:
	- 4 snapshots per frequency
	- 1 snapshot per time -- a combination of I, Q and U
	
lin2stokes.py:
	- keeps track of different weights for different beams
	- rotates all frames into same basis for easy working
	- 4 snapshots -> 4 *corrected* snapshots
	
QUrot.py:
	- As the sky passes overhead, an original Q will rotate into U and vice-versa
	- this corrects for LST changes, outputting Q, U, P=Q+U and a polarization-angle map
	
mk_snap_map.py
	- creates a "mosaic" healpix map
	
hpm_extract_facet.py
	- make a cutout from the healpix map in a sine projection
