TAKE CARE:

	- images are highly affected by the shape of the beam 
	- leakage terms in gain operator ("d terms") are very important.
		-- are these implemented?
	
READ:

	- TMS (edition 2+) chapters on geometry, chapters 3 and 6 (generally)
	- Haymaker, Bregman and Sault: 5 papers on "understanding radio polarimetry"... PAPER breaks most of their assumptions 
	- DFMs polarization papers
	- Perley & Smirnoff: NeqTree shows how useful polarization calibration can be
